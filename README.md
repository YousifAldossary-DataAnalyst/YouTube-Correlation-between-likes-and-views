## YouTube-Correlation-between-likes-and-views

OverView
In this Project, I analyze Youtube trending data from few countries:
  - USA
  - Canada
  - Japan
  - India
  - Duetschland
  - France
  - Great Britain
The target is to find the correlation between likes and views. I personally love finding correlations in data, because I am really good at it. Overall, I found stong correlation in likes and views from all countries. However, Japan had an extra strong correlation of comment vs views. Overall these are only trending videos. Moreover, this does not lead to causation. 

Dependencies
Python jupyter: numpy seaborn, panda, matplot, and matplot.pyplot
